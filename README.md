# EllipticiPy

A python package for the calculation of ellipticity corrections for seismic phases in elliptical planetary models.

Authors:
- Stuart Russell
- John F. Rudge
- Jessica C. E. Irving
- Sanne Cottaar

The workings of this package are described in the main paper:

Please cite this publication when publishing work that has made use of this package.


## Installation

The package can be installed using pip, the same as many python packages:

```
pip install ellipticipy
```

This package depends on ObsPy. For information regarding ObsPy please see the relevant documentation: https://docs.obspy.org/

## Usage

This package is intended to be used in Python:

```
>>> from obspy.taup import TauPyModel
>>> from ellipticipy import ellipticity_correction
>>> model = TauPyModel('prem')
>>> arrivals = model.get_ray_paths(source_depth_in_km = 124,
    distance_in_degree = 65, phase_list = ['pPKiKP'])
>>> ellipticity_correction(arrivals, azimuth = 39, source_latitude = 45)
[-0.7731978967098823]
```

For users that do not wish to directly interact with Python, there is a command line wrapper for calculating ellipticity corrections in [src/ellip](src/ellip). The Python package must be installed before the wrapper can be used.

```
> ./ellip -d 134 -deg 64 -az 15 -sl 23 -ph P,PcP,PKiKP -mod ak135
